# Interface-adaptive-to-visual-acuity
I have a business project, I'd like to launch software that would enable any technological interface to adapt to an individual's visual acuity via artificial intelligence.  
Main features:
Assessment of visual acuity via a series of tests or existing devices.
Automatic customisation of interfaces (font size, contrast, colour, brightness).
Real-time adjustments based on changes in the user's environment or condition.
Compatibility with various operating systems and devices.
